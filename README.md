This repository is a part of the documentation for MAS500 spring 2025 for group 3. 
The repository is forked from the repository combining the TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi robot platform with the OpenManipulator-X manipulator. 
This was done to share the changes made during development for MAS500 for the use of the robot platform and manipulator for autonomous deployment and liquid classification.
